For this project, you will be running a Design Sprint to further develop a concept to address the opportunity that you identified in the previous course. There are six phases of the Design Sprint. For this project there will also be two additional steps-- one optional step for iterating based on findings from user testing and one to prepare your concept for handoff.

Generally a Design Sprint is a cross functional exercise with team members participating from a number of different roles across your company (Design, Product, Eng, Marketing, etc). However, in order to allow flexibility for you to complete this project on your own timeline, you’ll be going through this Design Sprint on your own.

### Detailed Instructions
A Design Sprint is a cross-functional exercise with team members participating from a number of different roles across your company (Design, Product, Eng, Marketing, etc).

In this Design Sprint project, you’ll be going through the exercises on your own and we will simulate some of the group activities related to brainstorming.

### 0. Set the Stage
You will start a PRD that can be shared with the team to set the stage about why this problem matters. The first part of the PRD will include:

Any relevant background information
A problem statement which communicates the scope of the problem
Initial goals, which can continue to evolve throughout the project

### 1. Understand
Create a shared understanding of the problem space and identify opportunities through a “How Might We” exercise.

1. Create at least 8 virtual stickies that ask questions following the "How Might We" model
- Opportunities. Not solutions.
- Not too broad, and not too narrow
- One idea per sticky
2. Get input from other members of your digital "team"
- Find the slides of How Might We stickies that correspond with your project in the Appendix of the Design Sprint Starter template
- Copy the slides into the Understand section of your deck
3. Sort and group your stickies
- Group your stickies into the existing clusters or create new clusters and themes, if needed
- Feel free to rearrange existing stickies
4. Pick one theme that you want to move forward with and explain your rationale for selecting that theme

### 2. Define
By defining and focusing on the desired outcomes, you’ll be able to more clearly understand how to get there.

Write a future press review
Think about how you want users to respond to your product:
- Who is it for?
- What problem does it solve?
- How does it change a customer’s life?
- Why should customers love it?
- Use that information to draft a review from the perspective of the user

### 3. Sketch
Generate ideas for possible solutions based on the theme that you selected.

Create 8 quick sketches to quickly generate a few ideas.

1. Take a sheet of paper and fold it into 8 sections
- Sketch an idea in each of the 8 sections
- Spend about 1-2 minutes per sketch
- Pick two to develop into more detailed flows that clarify how the solution would work.

2. Spend about 30 minutes per sketch
- Sketch your idea in more detail than the last exercise -- use text annotations if needed
- Create at least 3 frames that show how the user progresses through the flow
- Include a title

### 4. Decide
Pick the final concept that you want to develop into a prototype

Pick your most compelling solution sketch

Explain why it’s the most compelling

### 5. Prototype
Turn your concept into a realistic, interactive prototype that you will use to validate your assumptions and ideas

Step 1. Storyboard
Create a storyboard based on your best solution sketch using either ThePlot.io or the template provided in the Design Sprint Project Starter Template. We’ll use the storyboard as the blueprint to create the prototype.

The storyboard should:
- Be high fidelity enough to build a prototype:
- Detail the steps a user goes through and how they progress from one step to the next
- Detail the layout of the software experience (wireframe level detail)
- Cover the entire user journey (ie: things that can happen outside the software experience)
- What prompts the user to use this?

Step 2. Prototype
Create an interactive prototype to showcase your concept

- Create mocks based on your storyboard using the Figma prototyping tool
- Use the prototype tool to define the flows
- Describe the concept that your prototype captures
- Describe the flows/tasks a user can complete in your prototype
- Add a link to your completed prototype in your project deck.

### 6. Validate
Users will go through your prototype and provide feedback on your concept. This is also an opportunity to have an engineering feasibility discussion

Step 1. Create a Research Plan
Create a research plan
- Identify your target user
- Map out the flow of the interview
- Intro
- Background information
- Tasks
- Wrap Up

Step 2. Run User Studies
Inviting users in to participate in studies is a great way to get feedback if you are on the right track. Additionally, it’s also easier to course correct at this point before any code has been written. We’re going to invite 2 users to try out the prototype that you built. You’ll use the research plan you created to guide the study and will record the audio from the session. You should also plan to take notes during the session.

Schedule two meetings with people you can interview about your prototype
Note: It might not be possible to find someone who meets your target user criteria-- and that’s ok for the sake of this exercise
- Run through your interview script in the research plan.
- You will ask some background questions to the participant and then ask them to complete several tasks
- Make sure to take notes during the interview (you can use the research plan as a template for notes)
- You should record the audio of the interview
- You should plan to spend about 30 minutes per interview 

### 8. Handoff
Refine the problem and goals section (if needed)
Complete the Key Features and Scope section
Link your mocks to the PRD
